# Welcome

Welcome to VITemu2, my PlayStation2 emulator. I'm creating it as way to learn how emulators work, and also to learn C++, with the help of ChatGPT.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or simply explore the code!

## Roadmap

- Improve CPU emulation (support for more instructions).
- Implement memory management and handle I/O devices.
- Add support for running actual PS2 games (with BIOS and ROM files).
- Add graphical output and controller input using SDL2.
- Optimize performance for better game compatibility.
